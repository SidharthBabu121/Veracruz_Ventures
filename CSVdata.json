The Project Capstone Team at UC Merced designed a small-scale roasting unit able to produce a range of through-put volumes without the need to interrupt the high-capacity line, for SNIs consideration. The design consisted of a rectangular frame with centrifugal fans facing the belts surface, installed at center. Resistive heat coils were utilized to allow for variable temperature control, an adjustable conveyor belt to accommodate varying line speeds and product depths, and centrifugal fans with adjustable CFM and RPM. The resistive coils, placed bilaterally, achieved uniform convection heating. Based on extensive thermal analysis, the Capstone Team concluded that the arrangement of components achieves uniform and efficient heating cycles.",

They use a tubular Conveyor belt to move almonds throughout their facility. A problem arises from the pucks that push the almonds as there is a buildup of residue oil on the edges of the puck. The current method of removing the residue is inefficient and time-consuming, thus the goal of this project is to make a more efficient cleaning solution. Our solution is a boxed air knife system that will blow off the residue and works in tandem with the tubular conveyor belt design.",

The team worked alongside Dr. Mark Stecker from the Fresno Institute of Neuroscience. The company is mainly involved in providing care to patients with neurologic problems as well as is involved in research and education. Patients with chronic pain or other neurologic conditions frequently note that their symptoms vary with environmental conditions. This includes heat, light, body position, and level of activity. It would be useful for the patient and their physician to know how these factors influence their main symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and/or weakness. This might allow the patient and their physician to build a treatment plan that mitigates these environmental factors. By using a combination of sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, etc.) along with Arduino boards, the patient can input the name and amount of medication they took that day. In addition, patients will be able to input the pain they might experience and the activities they participated in. A journal log will then be recorded concurrently as the sensor data allowing to build a patient-specific report.  Working alongside a software team at the University of California, Merced, we are building the file to create a system in which data will be downloaded to generate symptoms vs time graph and symptoms as a function of sensor readings. The recording of the data will come from small sensors with custom housing that will be placed on a patient. The data is collected over a set period of time (up to 72 hours) and recorded on a microSD card for exportation from the device. Once exported, the data can be analyzed by examining the trends within it; making correlations from the sensor data to the feedback from the input device.

Due to this, riders must position themselves outside of the normal seating area which is particularly true in non-paved surfaced cycling (i.e. mountain or gravel biking). This means that riders frequently place themselves behind, in front of, and/or below the seat which can lead to an eventual collision with the seat and injury, minor or major, to the abdomen, groin, or back. The Pi Shop, a non-profit product incubator located in Fresno, realized the shortcomings of modern bicycle seats and gave us, the Rough Riders, an opportunity to find a solution. We created one rapid prototype out of foam, wood, a cargo rack, and plenty of duct tape to showcase at a mountain biking event. We received varying feedback, but we learned that one size does not fit all when it comes to this attachment. We then created a CAD model of an adjustable seating attachment that can be quickly modified to meet varying needs meaning testing and prototyping could be done rapidly. This model effectively mitigates collision with the back of the bike seat while also guiding and supporting the rider so they can maneuver freely in varying biking situations.",

Different pests were found to have different tolerances to hot water treatments depending on the temperature of the water and the length of the treatment process. Most pests that were tested were killed when using water between 113F and 122F for treatment periods lasting between 5 and 15 minutes. The control system for the treatment container will have to be able to control the temperature of the water and the timeframe of the treatment period within these constraints.",

The air cells should be closed and have no spaces between cells in order to prevent air infiltration and thermal convection from compromising efficiency. The wall material defining the air cells should be of non-combustible material for maximum fire safety. We have chosen at this stage not to specify the wall thickness of the air cells or the other dimensions  and  geometry  so  that  these  can   be   theoretically optimized. However, we note that the small size (around1 mm or less) of air cells in conventional insulation is probably not optimum and more the result of material properties and processes. Double glazing air gaps are optimized at around 12 mm.  This is more likely to be a better scale for air cells. The desired horizontal insulation rating for a 300 mm (12 inch) block is greater than R50. The desired vertical structural strength is greater than a yield load of 200kPa",

With Trio Mating, 2 female mice and 1 male mouse are put into the same cage to produce a greater amount of pups compared to Pair Mating. Unfortunately, Trio Mating conflicts with the Guide For The Care And Use of Laboratory Animalsrecommendation of floor space for mice housed in groups. At least 51 sqof floor space is recommended for 1 female with a litter. Currently, with Trio mating 2 females and their litters are being placed in the same cage.In the most recent site review, the Association for Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) organization made a suggestion to reevaluate the practice of trio mating mice. Even though, the Vivarium has statistics to prove that Trio Mating is an efficient breeding method with little to no pup mortality, AAALAC wants documentation to prove that waste gas levels do not harm the health of mice.

Where the Capstone team of  Bobcat Agricultural Solutions will assist them in the goal of removing material other than tomato(MOT) during the harvesting process. The harvest of tomatoes vary depending on type. Market tomatoes are typically hand-picked, however for tomatoes that are turned into paste; harvester machines are the most efficient way of collection.There are many factors that are considered when harvesting since any delays can lead to a profit loss. Bobcat Agricultural Solution will focus on MOT removal by incorporating innovative system of rollers integrated onto the current harvester system. OLAM aims to reduce the amount of Material Other than Tomato that is being sent from the harvester to the trucks. As the harvester is picking the tomatoes, MOT still  circumvents the current MOT removal components of the harvester. To date the system is 99.57% effective of MOT removal.However removal of the remain percentage of MOT is very important in saving time and money for OLAM. In decreasing the MOT intake and increasing the tomato yield per truck, it will require less trucks to send the same amount of tomatoes to their plant, cause less downtime to remove the MOT. The proposed goal of  15% MOT removal, will save thousands of dollars on transportation, operational, and maintenance fees.",

At University of California Merced, professors and students use the irradiator at DARS to study the effects of radiation on animals and cells. Cesium-137 has a half-life of 30.17 years. As the radioactive isotope continues to decay, the irradiator has to be calibrated from time to time to ensure its giving out its predicted dose rate. The dose amount of radiation in the irradiator is determined by the amount of time its inside and the placement of the sample within the irradiator. Although calibrations for the irradiator are provided by the manufacturer, calibrations can be measured by dosimeters to help measure dose rates within the irradiator. Each part of the irradiator has a different dosage depending on its location from the Cesium source. These dose rates help create isodose curves for the irradiator that depict the different quantities of radiation within an area. Tissue-specific phantoms are used in the biomedical engineering field to help analyze and evaluate the performance of imaging devices.  Its purpose is to replicate how organs or tissues would react in an imaging device, without using legitimate organ/tissue samples. The material used to create tissue-specific phantoms are materials with resistant properties to high radiation that can be compared to help simulate an animal or a patient's exposure to radiation. Team Phantom aims to serve as a resource to UC Merceds Department of Animal Research (DARS). Through a quality assurance program, we will systematically provide accurate radiation distribution data for the Cesium-137 irradiator.

In addition to the McSwain dam and powerhouse, the facility is a member of the Merced River Hydroelectric Project (FERC P-2179), with an installed capacity of 94.5 MW at the New Exchequer Powerhouse. Routine maintenance at the facility requires the occasional removal of the approximately 30-ton hydroelectric turbine (also called a runner). Currently, this is accomplished by means of a lifting device which lowers the runner from its operational position at the base of the generator shaft. The lifting device vertically raises and lowers the runner along 4 threaded shafts that are installed to the base of the generator shaft. The runner is fully lowered onto a cart that operates on rails, and transports the runner to a position where it can be fully removed from the facility by means of a crane.",

From a literal perspective, treatment of such diseases depend on methods ranging from basic medication and monitoring heart-rate, to dialysis techniques and chemotherapy.  In order to perform such therapies though, equipment such as intravenous (IV) poles, infusion-pumps, and electrocardiograms must be present to monitor patient response during such treatment and ensure safe conditions to maximize treatment effectiveness.  In recent years, redesigns to the traditional IV pole have been emphasized due to factors of patient safety, nurse ergonomics, and overall instability [3]. Contributing to this revolution, IV League aims to prototype and fabricate an IV pole which improves load-distribution along the pole, enables safer  transport across elevator-gaps, and optimizes storage conditions.  To accomplish this, we implement heavy-duty recessed rollers, a large concealed base with smooth edges, and adjustable/insertablehooks.  In doing so, we aim to produce a safer IV pole that is better suited to endure conditions of a modern-day hospital.  ",

In addition, angiogenesis is a critical component in tissue engineering, as vessel growth is needed to supply blood to deeper tissues in organ growth and regeneration. Here, we performed a cost effective, novel technique for the fabrication of 3-dimensional scaffolds for the study and application of angiogenesis. We synthesized tubular porous polymers in a wide range of porosities with pore sizes in the microns range. Our material allow vascular cells to orient themselves in 3D space, a key element for vessel formation. These scaffolds can potentially advance the understanding and application of angiogenesis.

This unique project started with the initial constraint of taking an off the shelf, radio controlled boat and turning it into a water collection data device. After careful consideration and discussions with professors who are concerned with water data collection around the globe, we have produced a globally transportable, stable, and efficient design for single person use. Using the principle behind a SmallWaterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) design, a unique prototype was designed. The prototype is composed of PVC and ABS material for its longevity and affordability. The electronics system encompasses a transducer, GPSnavigation, data logging and sensor payload system that work simultaneously to collect decision quality water data.The prototypes performance was tested and the design and functionality of the unmanned surface vehicle was successful.

The production of these materialsyields residuals effects such as outgoing decibel levels of 90 decibels. In an 8-hourperiod, decibel levels of 85 dB and over require ear protection. 90 dB requires single ear protection at the least, with anything at 100 dB an up requiring double ear protection for any workers in the area or exposed to the noise. Hence, Santa Fe Aggregates processing proposed a project for Solinus Solutions in the field of industrial noise abatement, mitigation and control. After research and testing, Solinus Solutions decided that that wrapping of  inch butyl rubber around the cone crushers, will achieve the necessary results set out by both client and company.

The model was built using empirical equations that were found in literature based on the dehydration of onions. With the model, the user can input parameter values for the initial moisture content of the onion, the drying air temperature, the drying air speed, the belt speed, and the belt length. In return, the model outputs graphs that characterize the drying behavior of the product. For given user-defined input settings, the model also computes the final moisture content of the onions at each stage. A graphical user interface was also created to provide an easy-to-use version of the software model. With the interface, the user can choose any given dryer stage he or she wants to focus on and input the desired parameter values for that stage to receive real-time plots on the display. The report concludes by suggesting that further experimental data from Olamcan aid in understanding their dryer performance and lead to improved accuracy and future optimization and automation applications.",

Water flows and quality are affected and altered throughout the year by water allocations, when flows are above minimum ecological flows, and the release of low quality water back into the river when water quality metrics are above a minimum standard. This system of give and take is heavily reliant on access to reliable and real-time water flow and quality data . This data improves decision support systems for water resource management, especially when available surface water is below average and during recurring or periodic droughts. The current issue with the optical sensors is a malfunction in the mechanical wiper system that is attached to each sensor. The wipers that are attached on the top of the sensors are not positioning in their original position causing the wiper to station on top of the sensors. In addition, the wipers are used periodically every 15 minutes resulting to abrasive wear on the caps causing leakage. Due to this leakage, the data acquired from the sensors becomesinaccurate. Hence, our design must stay within boundaries of sonde cap, require less power to operate wiper, incur less resistance against river current, reduce chances of fatigue due to compact wiper, and eliminate any chance of wear and tear of O-rings on each individual sensors preventing leakage through shaft.",

Currently the grafting process is labor extensive and time consuming. An automated machine to handle some aspect of this procedure could optimize the grafting industry. Three areas of the grafting process were offered to begin designing a prototype for optimization.These included creating a machine to insert the rootstock and scion together to hold, taping these two portions together, or counting the grafts and sorting them 100 per bundle. Our team chose the taping portion of grafting. Our mission was to design and develop an automated prototype that fastens the scion and rootstock together with biodegradable tape to produce a healthy graft.The prototype should be safe for non highly skilled workers to operate, provide a means of increasing the current production, and have a total process time of completing one graft in less than 15 seconds. This time was approximated by observing manual workers and the time it took them to tape and complete a graft. ",

Having an electric tractor on campus was eco-friendly enough for us, but could still be improved upon; therefore we decided to make self sustainable via solar power. The solar powered tractor will be used to transport the campuss compost with zero emissions. It can also charge a battery pack, consisting of 4-12V lead acid deep cycle batteries connected in series, in about three hours. This provides about three hours of runtime using a 15 hp electric motor, and towing a max load of 4000 lbs. The tractor is powered by two 290 polycrystalline solar panels mounted directly onto the tractor for easier charging no matter where the tractor might be. The compost is loaded onto a trailer that was adapted for towing mainly compost, having a door that becomes a ramp to load the bins, but it can be used for other tasks as well. This design fits University of California, Merceds sustainability goals to consume no offsite or nonrenewable energy, to produce no net carbon emissions, and to produce no landfill waste by 2020. The tractor fulfills the compost programs needs along with the campuss environmental goals. The tractor has been designed to transport the campuss compost in an eco-friendly manner by not emitting any greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The tractor will be towing the compost from the dinning commons area to the compost area located about 2 miles away. The setup consist of a reinforced almond trailer, and two solar panels mounted on the tractor to charge the battery pack that power the motor. ",

Pioneered in the early 1900s primarily for the production of textiles. This expensive technique is transforming many areas of research due to the customizable materials it produces. The electrospun fibrous mats produced can have variable porosity and fiber diameter from micro- to nano-scale in size, making them useful in a wide range of applications, particularly in biomedical and tissue engineering applications. In particular, electrospun fibers can be useful in vascular tissue engineering, providing the mechanical scaffold for smooth muscle and vasculature tissue that is necessary for applications like arterial grafts.",
